Howdy! I'm Evan, and if you're reading this you probably want to know a little bit about me. I've been a professional iOS developer / engineer / programmer since 2011, and in that time have worked on about a dozen apps at companies ranging in size from four to four thousand. I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Etsy working on Gifting.

Outside of work, I spend time with my wife and two kids, mostly at and around our home in Houston, TX. I enjoy photography, basketball, skiing, video games, reading, watching too much TV, and taking my too-energetic-for-how-old-he-is australian shepherd on walks. 

If you'd like to chat, please reach out via email. I used to use Twitter for this but... for _reasons_ I have not been active on that service in some time.
