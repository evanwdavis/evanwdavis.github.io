Alright, halfway through the month and how am I doing? OK. 

**No Alcohol**
 
So far this is actually going well, despite a few situations where a little buzz would have been nice. I've successfully done karaoke and attended a concert with a questionable opening act and not had a sip of an alcoholic drink. There have definitely been times (mostly college) where this would have seemed impossible, but I think knowing I can go back to business as usual next month makes it pretty tolerable. 

**No TV Shows**
 
This one is also going well. I've filled the time with some movies (currently working through the Harry Potter series at about a movie per week) and reading. It'll be tough not to immediately go back to TV binging next month, but if that happens I'll probably just take another pause for March. 

**git commit Every Day**
 
This one's going... OK. I missed yesterday, and some of the other days have been obeying the letter of this goal, but not necessarily the spirit. I know it was ambititous so I'm not too worried about it, but it's something I want to do better at for the next two weeks. 

**Finish 2 Books**
 
Technically I've already [completed](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50978104-evan) it! The Crossroads of Should and Must was pretty short though, so I'd like to knock out another one before the month is over.

**Run 75 Miles**

This got off to an awful start. After a good 4 mile run on New Years Day I played in an all day volleyball tournament the next day, and spent the next week and a half with a swollen knee, unable to run. I'm just now getting back into it, so I'll likely be a long ways from hitting this target. I can still ramp up (slowly over the next month or so) and get back on track for the yearly goal though.

**Bike to Work 12 Days**

I'm going to cut this one close, but not because I haven't been biking. I'm at 6 so on pace, but between ski trip(s) the next two weeks and the occasional work from home day, I'll need to bike to work every day. Hopefully the weather allows and I stick to it!

**Weekly Checkin Journals**
 
Yup! 

Alrighty, two weeks to go this month, gotta finish strong and start turning an eye towards next month. TV and Drinking will be nice to bring back, but for a new monthly challenge I'm gearing up for a month of no added sugar... which is going to be tough. There's a reason I'm doing it the shortest month of the year.
