Hey there 2016 what's up. 

Skiing is awesome

but seriously, let's do something here. where am I right now? what am I focusing on? 

Sustainability? in job, health, relationships, dog, finances? I think I'm coming into the year from a good place, so time to build on it. I'm settled in SF, new job working on somethign I'm passionate about, still making good money, trying not to spend too much. Don't want to brag but i'm ok. 2015 had some low points in my head so it's nice to be optimistic again. 

here we go yall 

but yeah, good job, making an app, finally feeling halfway motivated to actually do shit now... not feeling like you're gonna get fired for not doing anything is always good. 

skiing was good too! 


taking a lesson was awesome, need to soak it in, probably do another one next time! level up! 

lesson paid off, lots more confident! even accidentally did a black and finished the day off with a tough double blue. boom
